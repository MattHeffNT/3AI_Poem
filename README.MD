## Rules for adding to the poem 

As a cohort, we are going to write a poem, line by line about the Northern Territory.​

We are going to work in pairs to draft lines for the poem, which will then be considered by the group and voted on. The line with the most votes, will get committed to the poem.​

The poem must cover at least 5 of the topics listed below (feel free to use Google/Urban Dictionary to look these up):

- Crocodiles​

- Salty plums​

- The word ‘gammin’​

- Uluru/Kata tjuta​

- Trever the rubbish warrior (?)​

- Djapana/sunset dreaming​

- The attempted coup against Andrew Giles/some funny crocs in the cabinet story​

- Seabed mining​

- Kakadu​

- Laksa​

- Magpie geese​

- The Fannie Bay Cool Spot
